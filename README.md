# ESPERANZA Video Converter

This script is intended to help convert a video into other formats specified in the script.  

We are not responsible for any damage caused to the converted videos.  

The script uses **ffmpeg**, based on Fedora Core 23. No tests have been performed on earlier versions of Fedora Core.  

The script can be freely adapted, as long as proper credit is given to the creator.  

Those interested in making improvements, please send the updated script to **lccoder.php@gmail.com**. Credits will be given to the author of the changes, and the script will be uploaded to GitHub.  

Currently, Esperanza only supports conversion to the **mp4** format.  

## Usage

Give permission 755 to the script:
```bash
chmod 755 esperanza
